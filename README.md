# POS Tagger for small, endangered languages

A part-of-speech tagger build from scratch by implementing a hidden Markov model and the Viterbi algorithm. I created the tagger during the seminar *Einführung in die Computerlinguistik* held by Prof. Dr. Roland Meyer during the winter semester 2023/24 at *Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin*.

Additional information as well as the seminar paper will follow soon.
