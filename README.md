# POS Tagger for small, endangered languages

<<<<<<< HEAD
A part-of-speech (POS) tagger including a hidden Markov model (HMM) and the Viterbi algorithm build from scratch in Python.

I created the tagger during the seminar *Einf체hrung in die Computerlinguistik* held by Prof. Dr. Roland Meyer during the winter semester 2023/24 at *Humboldt-Universit채t zu Berlin*.
